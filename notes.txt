# - single line comment

Print

- in python 3 print('')

'''
This is a 
multiline comment
or docstring (used to define a functions purpose)
can be single or double quotes
'''

VARIABLE
variables.py
RULES:
- Variable names are case sensitive (name and NAME are different variables)
- Must start with a letter or an underscore
- Can have numbers but can not start with one
- strings can have single or double quotes
- for boolean True or False(not lowercase)
- multiple assignmnent can be done for variables on a single line --> x, y, name, is_cool = (1, 2.5, 'John', True)
- check type of variable --> print(type(x))
- Casting x = str(x) y = int(y)

STRINGS
strings.py

- Strings in python are surrounded by either single or double quotation marks

LISTS

-- A List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members. (same as array in JS)

TUPLES and sensitive

-- A Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
-- A Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.

-- tuple with one element needs trailing comma or else it is considered as string

DICTIONARY

-- A Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.

FUNCTIONS

-- A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. In Python, we do not use parentheses and curly brackets, we use indentation with tabs or spaces

LAMBDA FUNCTIONS

-- A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
-- A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression. Very similar to JS arrow functions

CONDITIONALS
-- If/ Else conditions are used to decide to do something based on something being true or false
-- Comparison Operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) - Used to compare values
-- Logical operators (and, or, not) - Used to combine conditional statements
-- Membership Operators (not, not in) - Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object
-- Identity Operators (is, is not) - Compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:

LOOPS

-- A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
-- While loops execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

MODULES

-- A module is basically a file containing a set of functions to include in your application. There are core python modules, modules you can install using the pip package manager (including Django) as well as custom modules

PIP
-- pip is python package manager
-- pip freeze -- show all global python package installed

CLASSES

-- A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. An object has properties and methods(functions) associated with it. Almost everything in Python is an object
-- self is equivalent to this in JS or java

FILES

-- Python has functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.

JSON
-- JSON is commonly used with data APIS. Here how we can parse JSON into a Python dictionary
